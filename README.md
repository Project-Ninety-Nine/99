App Evaluation
Category: Food & Drink
Story: Displays drinks and filters them displayed based on user's specifications.
Market: Individuals 18 and up.
Habit: This app can be used as often as the user wants to use it.
Scope: We would start with sharing drink recipes and expand to something more social where people can 
interact with each other and follow others on the site to get notified when they upload drink recipes. 
We could also branch off into soemthing more busines oriented like an app that we can sell to bars so 
their bartenders can more easily access recipes they need at a moments notice.
