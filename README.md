### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Food & Drink
- **Story:** Allows users to view different alcoholic beverages and drinks along with their ingredients.
- **Market:** Any individual over the age of twenty one could choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** This app can be used as much as a user wants to.
- **Scope:** We would start with sharing drink recipes and expand to something more social where people can 
             interact with each other and follow others on the site to get notified when they upload drink recipes. 
             We could also branch off into soemthing more busines oriented like an app that we can sell to bars so 
             their bartenders can more easily access recipes they need at a moments notice.
